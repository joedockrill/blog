**Joe Dockrill**

I was a professional software developer for about 10 years, but I’ve been programming for over 30.

I first started coding with C++ back when compilers came on boxes full of 3.5″ floppies, tried some 8086 assembly for at least a week, before eventually moving on to Visual Basic which is actually the best language ever (and no, I do not mean that sarcastically).

My professional development career started with some messy client/server/mainframe stuff (MFC/Oracle/IDMS), more VB and then a *lot* of web development (Asp, .NET, Sql Server etc). I think that’s when my brain gave up hope and moved out.

After a decent sized break away from IT for family reasons, I’m looking for something more interesting and challenging to do for the rest of my working life, so my geek wife pointed me in the direction of data science, and I’m completely hooked.

I’m **very** interested in deep learning, and I’m currently spending as much time as I can playing with [fast.ai](http://fast.ai). I love the library and their philosophy on pretty much everything fits very nicely with my own.

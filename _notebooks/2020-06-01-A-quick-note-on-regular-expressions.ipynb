Regular expression patterns (sometimes known as regex) are something you should know about.\n",

        "Regular expressions can do quite complicated text pattern matching which would often take some quite cumbersome code otherwise. They take a bit of learning and getting used to but I’ll give you the briefest introduction so you can at least understand why it’s worth the effort to learn.\n",

There are plenty more like this. Go and play…\n",

        "Now I know a bit more than I did the first time around, I can do a slightly better job at data cleaning and feature engineering, but mainly I thought I’d try something technically known as “not throwing random models I don’t understand properly at the data”.\n",

After trying a basic logistic regression, we discover a mass of different classifier types we didn’t know existed so we try a bunch from other peoples notebooks (only most of them have also cut & pasted from other places without understanding them either).\n",

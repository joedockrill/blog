        "I see a lot of effort going standardising names and I don’t see the value. Is someone known as Colonel as likely to survive as someone known as Mr? Potentially it might be interesting to flag non-standard titles, eg: males NOT known as Mr or Master, females not known as Miss Mrs Mlle, Mme etc, but not to fudge them all to Mr & Mrs.\n",
        "\n",
        "FWIW the full list of titles seems to be:\n",

        "‘Mr’, ‘Master’, ‘Major’, ‘Rev’, ‘Dr’, ‘Col’, ‘Capt’, ‘Don’, ‘Jonkheer’\n",

        "titanicfacts.net has a passenger list which indicates where certain passengers were employed by others (eg: nanny/maid/manservant/nurse to other_passenger). This is interesting but doesn’t appear to be in our data, at least from the sample rows I’m seeing so far. These account for 38 first class passengers and I assume that this would be a significant factor if I can engineer it back out of the kaggle data.\n",

        "Some people are using family size (SibSp + Parch) as an indicator. “Women and children first” surely took precedence over family sizes and the notion of giving up your place for a family member. If this is a factor then I think it needs treating carefully. One thing which is feasible is the idea that people with family members would have spent time and effort of looking after each other, or even just looking for each other (although the latter probably not a significant factor given the time of the accident; most families would probably have been in bed in their cabins). \n",

</ul><p>I should really be cracking on with my data science course but I’ve gone on a tangent to play with the Titanic data.</p>

<p>So far I have:</p>

<p><strong>Engineered out a Title column from the names.</strong> <br>
This is actually quite easy with a regular expression.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import re
def ExtractTitle(name):
     ptn = "[^,]*,\s(the\s)?([^\.]*)"
     p = re.compile(ptn, re.IGNORECASE)
     m = p.match(name)
 
     if m is not None:
          return m.group(2)
     else:
          print("FAILED EXTRACTING TITLE FROM: " + name)
          return None
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Added a Noble flag.</strong><br>
This is for nobility titles like Sir, Countess, Lord, Lady etc. There actually aren’t as many of these in the train 
data as I expected, if there aren’t more in test then this flag may not be that helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Added SexPlus column.</strong> <br>
This is to expand male/female to man/woman/boy/girl. I expect this to be a useful feature as children were obviously 
not treated in the same way as adults (but I expect that boys were not treated equally to girls).</p>

<p>I’ve chosen 16 as the cut-off point. Legally people were considered completely independent of their parents at 21 at this 
time, but there were a myriad of points at which children started progressing towards adulthood in different ways.</p>

<p>All I’m interested in is how they were treated in regards to places on lifeboats, and the information from historical 
accounts suggests that was somewhere around 14-16 but was not clearly defined.</p>

<p><strong>Dealt with missing ages.</strong> <br>
20% of the data does not have an age set. So far I have used median ages based on Title. That’s good enough for men, 
boys, and married women, but for other females I should be able to look at Parch and SibSp and take a more educated 
guess at whether they are girls or single women.</p>

<p><strong>Plotting.</strong> <br>
After that I did some basic plotting to look at survival rates.
<a href="/blog/images/TitanicEDA1.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly women and children did better than men, but within children, girls did better than boys.</p>

<p>There’s nothing especially stunning jumping out at this point.</p>

<p>Next I ran some regression plots to look at survival rates by age on a line.
<a href="/blog/images/TitanicEDA2.jpg"></a></p>

<p>There is obviously at least one outlier in the male data causing an issue and I need to look at trimming here. Boys and girls needs further attention, possibly by Pclass.</p>

<p>The next things I need to investigate are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cabin number. I can get the deck from cabin number but I’m not sure what else, and so few of these are present that 
I don’t expect it to be much use.</li>
  <li>Family groups. I need to look at Parch, SibSp, ticket numbers, cabin numbers etc and try to determine the groups 
travelling together, and add a column for GroupSize(?)</li>
  <li>Ticket numbers. This may be useful as part of family processing but I’m not sure what else I can gather from these.</li>
  <li>Fare. The size of the fare may be useful as fare can vary a lot even within Pclass (a 1st class berth was £30 but 
there were 2 suites going for £870 and presumably a fair bit in the middle). This needs to be in conjunction with trying 
to calculate a fare per person as some tickets prices appear to be a sum for everyone in that group.</li>
  <li>Look at which interactions I want to add. I expect most of the value I’m going to add from this point to come from here.</li>
</ul>
